Q: are these the polynomial functors topologists and category theorists expect

TODO:
- See also Agda stdlib containers
- Can quantum circuits be expressed using Poly?
- mu and nu for least and greatest fixed point
- coalgebras (and unfold) as an alternative definition for systems 
- relation to profunctors for optics?
- Directed containers and Derivatives of Poly http://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/~psztxa/publ/jpartial.pdf https://danel.ahman.ee/papers/fossacs12.pdf

Prove comonads in poly are categories
